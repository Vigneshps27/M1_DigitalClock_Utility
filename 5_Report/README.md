# REQUIREMENTS

A digital clock is used to measure accurate time. It is also used as stop watch. It indicates the current time. This is done by indicating hours, minutes and seconds in the format of numbers.A hour is a period of time equal to a twenty-fourth part of a day and night and divided into 60 minutes, a minute is a period of time equal to sixty seconds or a sixtieth of an hour and a second is a sixtieth of a minute.


# ADVANTAGES

Clocks are a simple and effective tool which help us to indicate the time in 24 hour format. The important part is practicing to use the time wisely, and following through with your activities according to the time blocks you assign yourself. Your time and attention are your most valuable resources, donâ€™t let them go to waste.

* View current time in 24 hours format
* Can be used as Stop Watch
* Can be used as a running clock by setting time
* Displayed as Hours:Minutes:Seconds


# DISADVANTAGES

* Corruption may occur
* If only user set's time, can be used as running clock 

# CONCLUSION

Finally I conclude that using the C programing we can build a digital clock. I have learned to make our code more efficient and also works under any kind situation.The concepts of C program which I have used in the code is very understandable and userfriendly, from this project I gained many experience related to industrial structure that how should the project should be started and ended in industrial and civilized manner.
